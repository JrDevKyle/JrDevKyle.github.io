Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client was Artemis Financial. I was tasked to choose a algorithm cipher that would improve the companies financial data.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? 
I found certain vulnerabilities that were very serious when it came to authentication. Some vulnerabilities would disregard log in information or be easily accessed on the admin side. 

Why is it important to code securely? 
Because it prevents breeches in security. For example, if a code does not hide important certificate information or login information, a hacker could view these sensitive information in the code. 

What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
It profects their clients sensitive information which maintains the companies crediblity. This helps with the overall success of the company.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I think the sheer volume of vulnerabilities was overwhelmiing to go through and some of the descriptions were too advanced for me to understand. It seems a strong background in system administration focused on the server side of things is key towards fixing many vulnerabilities. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I think that by creating a certificate, we added a layer of security. I think in the future I would run dependency checks against my code to check for areas that I needed to improve on.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I think that by running the appication in eclipse and verifying in the web browser, we can verify the code worked. Running depenendency checks helps with vulnerabilities and helps fix them.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Eclipse, running the pom.xml configuration, running dependency checks, and creating certificates.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I could demonstrate that I know how to create certificates and run dependency checks against my code.
