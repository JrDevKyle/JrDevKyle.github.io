README for TreasureHuntGame
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The company is developing a treasure hunt game where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirates find it.
The company requested a treasure hunt game where the game attempts to find the treasure before the user does. I worked 
mainly on the Q-Training Algorithm where I would help the program be able to go through the process of finding the treasure.
I felt that the methods of how the program would try to locate the treasure focused on trial and error. 

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists seek to understand and develop softwarea applications, hardware, and are behind the desigining of it.
They help bring great applications to the market like Google Maps, Youtube, and Gmail.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Computer scientists approach problems systematically. They gather information and going through errors in a step by step process.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical resonsibilities include developing a game that is not bias to any user or organization.
