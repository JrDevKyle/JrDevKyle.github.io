How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I use unit tests to test default input data that I add to my test cases to check for certain scenarios
where the user enters bad data. I lay out appropriate error handling to catch those situations.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I saw what imporant information the user would need to enter such as first name, last name,
phone number, address, etc. This is the basic user information I would enter.

How do I approach designing software?
Designing software starts with creating diagrams to understand the behavioral process as well as the procedural.
I would like there to be different diagrams that outline the application such as UML case diagrams and flow diagrams.
