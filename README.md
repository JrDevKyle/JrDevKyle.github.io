# 8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

PLEASE REFER TO MY SUBMISSION "RUNTIME ANALYSIS.DOCX" AND MY "PROJECT2.ZIP" COMMITS TO FULIFLL THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE RUBRIC.
Incase you would like to see my full document for project one, I committed that also.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For the project the goals were to create a functioning program that would act as a sort of 
tool for others to orgainize their course schedule. It allowed courses to be added, removed, searched, etc. 
There were many different types of ways in which we could organize the data for simplicity and efficency.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

There were a few different ways in which to organize the data. We used vectors, binary trees, hashtables.
I personally liked vectors the most because after the analysis, I found that it had a faster runtime than the others.
I also felt that creating simple, easy to use functions was the best approach.


How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I think what helps is using the pseudocode to use as a kindof drawing board. It was easy to get lost or forget 
where I was in the process. Using the pseudo code, this became easier to always go back to.


How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I never really wrote much pseudocode in the past, I usually would dive right into the project. Pseduocode help as a map to what I have done and what I need
to do next.


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I've become more organized with the way I write code. I have found that classes, inheritence are extremely important for organization. 
However, data structures are just as important, I never really thought about efficency. This course helped me to see how I could organize complex data.
