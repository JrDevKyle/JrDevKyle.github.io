Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass who wanted to have a web-based application that would allow students to enroll in courses, exams, driving tests, and have the
ability to schedule appointments. 

What did you do particularly well?
I think I was able to show the process fairly well through diagrams. I think what I particularly liked were flow UML diagrams which outlined what
classes I needed for the application.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would improve my client presentation better next time. I think clients would want a demonstration of how a user would 
typically experience using the application. I believe that this would be something I would add next time. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried to think how the user would for the application. What are the basic things a user needed to have to use the website? This was important because a user is not thinking about the development side of things when using an applicaition. They are really focused on the functionality, what they need to do with it.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software now by creating diagrams. I see what needs to be created and I try to show a complete picture of the process. I think by outlining the whole process first, I can focus then on the smaller componennts of the application.
