Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
My goal was to create an inventory app that performed some of the most basic functionality including create, read, update, and delete.
The app is to help organize inventory on a business scale. Comapnies can add, update, and remove iteams from their inventory system.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
Things like login screens, areas to add, update, or remove the item. I wanted to make sure the screens were not cluttered but had a simplistic view so as to not confuse the user.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I did some research, created diagrms, and having worked in a warehouse myself, I am familiar with inventory applications so I knew what specific features were critical. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
By running the code and viewing the expected outcome. Usually I will know quickly if there are errors from the IDE.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I think using the IDE was challenging. I had not used this particular IDE before so it was a challenege to learn how to use it effectiviely to finish projects.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I would say the layout of the application. I am familiar with inventory applications and I know what are important features or non important features.
