# CS-230-Project

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was "The Gaming Room". The application that the company wanted to design was called "Draw It or Lose it". This application was a cross-platform application, capable of being played on varios operating systems. The game is a puzzle competition that shows users images so they can guess the correct phrase. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I felt that I was able to effectively show what requirements each OS would require in terms of components, services, security, and development needed for the application. I was able to give recommendations such as making Windows the primary OS for the company, using third-party hosting services to manage server and security needs, and also showed alternatives if the company wanted to take more of a traditional approach. I was able to show potential costs for the company and where they can save. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I particularly liked the UML diagram because it helped me remember what private members belonged where and what methods belonged to what class. Its also helpful for inheritence. I will absolutley be using UML diagrams in the future when building projects. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably improve the areas where I gave recommendations regarding the Linux OS. I am not very familiar with Linux but would like to learn. I think with a little more research, I could add better information for Linux users. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
One of the main needs was for the app to be cross-platformed on various OS. This was a primary need and critical to deliver on because the more OS the game can be played on, the more success for the app. The most important thing are the client needs because one could lose a client if they are not carfeul to listen to what vision the client has for their product. There is some level of management from the development side of things that can help the client understand what can and cannot be done. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached it first by using a UML diagram. Flow charts are quite useful to logically think how user inputs and system responses will happen. I also felt that the design document was able to clearly separate highly important sections of the design that needed to be thought through. I think writing an essay, listing all the requirements each OS would need would be quite a mess! Therefore, the design document helped organize these requirements in a way for both the developer and client to understand.
