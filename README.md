How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
Good coding starts with proper planning. Diagrams help layout important processes, how things link, and what code/functionality we will need.
Also practicing clean code is important. It's important to make things as simple as possible and not overcomplicate or clutter the code.

Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I think that this kept things more organized. Being able to use a seperate file and reference that in the code, helps manage the program and also help in the debugging process in case something does not work and I have to go digging.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I approach it by first not panicking. I go through the stack trace or whatever error is on the terminal. From there, I try to do as little guessing as I possibly can and try to work the error. I have found that I resolve little errors along the way until finally solving the biggest one. This course made me use the terminal much more, I think that helped my cmd skills. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer Scientists develop and maintain computer software and hardware. They seek to make things more efficient for example, they consider performance in a software program. The work done helps analysis so the user can draw different scenarios with a few inputs of their own. Without computers, we would not have efficency we do today, in fact, we would not have the wonderful tech toys that we have around or the important services that rely on computers etc.
